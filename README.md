# Introductory AWS workshop

The goal of this workshop is to familiarise yourself with the fundamentals of how our apps are hosted on AWS. AWS is full of jargon and abbreviations, but hopefully by stepping through deploying a basic test app we can demystify what some of these services do. This is a self directed workshop with some questions and exercises to consolidate your learning. Knowledge of docker and the benefits of containerised services is assumed.

Our infrastructure boils down to containers in the cloud.

By the end of this workshop we should be able to answer the following questions.

1. How do they get there?
2. Who starts them running?
3. How do they talk to each other and the internet?
4. How do they respond to load?

Work through deploying a basic app first, in turn applying this new knowledge to unpacking how the SPA is deployed and contrasting the ECS, Fargate and plain EC2 setups.

Refer to the [AWS workshop repo](https://github.com/miamollie/aws-workshop) to find source code for the app to deploy, as well as templates and the commands needed. Follow the steps outlined in `ops/readme.md`. You can refer to the [glossary](https://github.com/miamollie/aws-workshop/blob/master/ops/glossary.md) for an TLAs and AWS jargon.
